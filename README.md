# SVM_InteractiveNotebook
An interactive Google Colab Notebook to demonstrate affect of C on the optimal soft margin hyperplane

# Problem Description
Generate a small, linearly separable dataset in two dimensions. Give the dataset at least one outlier, i.e., a datapoint that looks like it should below to the other class (but it should still be linearly separable). Code up the optimal soft margin hyperplane, and display the hyperplane on a graph together with the data. Use a slider corresponding to the constant C with logarithmic spacing. Your widget should demonstrate the affect of C as it is varied.
